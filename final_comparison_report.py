print("\n[Option A] Use OFFICIAL RATE CARD (Current Implementation)")
print("  Pros:")
print("    + Matches current/future Global Cargo pricing")
print("    + Protects against undercharging")
print("    + Official document provided by Global Cargo")
print("  Cons:")
print("    - Will not match December billing (December may have had discounts)")

print("  Pros:")
print("    + Matches historical billing data")
print("    + Better accuracy for past bills")
print("  Cons:")
print("    - May not reflect current/future pricing")
print("    - Risk of undercharging if rates have increased")
print("    - Unofficial rate structure")

print("\n[Option C] HYBRID APPROACH")
print("  Pros:")
print("    + Use official rates but make minimum LR configurable")
print("    + Can toggle minimum on/off based on customer agreement")
print("  Cons:")
print("    - Requires additional configuration management")
